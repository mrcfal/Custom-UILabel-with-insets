# Custom-UILabel-with-insets
This Swift Xcode project shows how to create a custom UILabel with insets (left and right insets in this example).

## Why should I use it?

Providing insets to labels usually saves me to set spacing between components and the label or between the label and 
a view's borders. Using a custom UILabel you are able to adjust your text programmatically in one step.

_drawText (in rect: CGRect)_ is the function to override.
